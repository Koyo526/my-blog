## Introduction

Nice to meet you! I'm Koyo, a Java engineer.
Happy New Year 2026!

In 2025, I moved to the Kanto region and started my first year as an engineer.
It was a year full of learning and experiences.

## Towards My Second Year as an Engineer

In my second year, I want to grow even more than last year and expand my skill set.
In particular, I want to focus on sharing my knowledge externally.
I'd like to write articles about my learnings and experiences, and actively participate in lightning talks.

(I may make mistakes, but I'd appreciate gentle feedback!)

## I Created This Site

Since my student days, I've always wanted to have my own website.
However, I kept procrastinating and it took until now...

As a second-year engineer, I decided to push myself to grow and created this portfolio site
through `New Year's Holiday Driven Development`!

I'll be using this for my blog and development logs!

I plan to update this regularly. Thank you for your support!
